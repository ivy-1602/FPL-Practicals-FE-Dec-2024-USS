# 📝 FPL Practicals - FE Semester 1
## Fundamentals of Programming Language (SPPU)

These are my first C++ programs from college. Nothing fancy, just the basics done right.

---

## What's Here

Five assignments that taught me how to actually write code:

1. **Salary Calculator** - Math with money
2. **Fibonacci Series** - Understanding patterns
3. **Math Operations** - Square, square root, factorial
4. **Student Result** - Grading system with if-else
5. **String Operations** - Playing with text

---

## Running These

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o filename
./filename
```

That's it. Compile, run, done.

## What I Learned

### The Basics That Matter

**Assignment 1** - Basic arithmetic, understanding variables  
Started simple. Calculate salary from basic pay. DA and HRA percentages. Got comfortable with float and calculations.

**Assignment 2** - Loops and sequences  
Fibonacci series taught me how loops actually work. The temp variable trick for swapping values made sense here.

**Assignment 3** - Functions and math  
Three small programs: square, square root/cube, and factorial. Learned about cmath library and how to break code into functions.

**Assignment 4** - Decision making  
Student grading system. Multiple if-else statements. First time dealing with real-world logic - grades, percentages, pass/fail.

**Assignment 5** - String manipulation  
Length, reverse, palindrome check, string comparison. Realized strings aren't that scary. Just arrays of characters with extra steps.

## What Actually Helped

- **Start small** - These programs aren't complex. They don't need to be.
- **Test everything** - Run the code. See what breaks. Fix it.
- **Understand, don't memorize** - Why does factorial use a loop? Because you multiply n numbers together.
- **Read errors** - Compiler tells you exactly what's wrong. Usually.

## Common Mistakes I Made

1. Forgot semicolons (every beginner's story)
2. Didn't like the language itself!
3. Didn't initialize variables
4. Didn't like the blue screen
5. Overthought simple problems

## Tips for FE People:

If you're doing FPL right now:

- **Don't copy-paste blindly** - Type it out. Seriously. Muscle memory helps.
- **Change the numbers** - Run the program with different inputs. See what happens.
- **Break things** - Remove a line. See what error you get. Learn from it.
- **Ask why, not just how** - Why do we need that loop? Why float instead of int?
- **It's okay to struggle** - Everyone's first programs look like this. It gets better.

## What's Different from the Original

I cleaned up the code a bit:
- Added proper comments and problem statements
- Used `cout` instead of `printf` (C++ way)
- Better variable names
- Cleaner output formatting
- Fixed some logic issues

But the core logic? Same. These are still the FE practicals you know.

## Looking Back

These programs are simple. That's the point.

You don't start with complex algorithms. You start with "how do I add two numbers?" and "how does a loop work?"

Six months later, I'm writing sorting algorithms and working with trees. But it started here. With salary calculations and Fibonacci series.

If you're in FE and thinking "everyone else is better at this" - they're not. Everyone starts confused. Some just hide it better.

Write the code. Break it. Fix it. Repeat.

That's how you learn.

## Requirements

- g++ compiler (any recent version)
- Basic understanding of C++ syntax
- Willingness to make mistakes

---

## Files

- `01_salary_calculator.cpp` - Calculate gross salary
- `02_fibonacci_series.cpp` - Generate Fibonacci sequence
- `03_math_operations.cpp` - Basic math functions
- `04_student_result.cpp` - Grading system
- `05_string_operations.cpp` - String manipulations

Each file has:
- Problem statement
- Clean, commented code
- Sample output
- What you're supposed to learn from it
